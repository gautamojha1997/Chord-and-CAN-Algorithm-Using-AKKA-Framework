### Modules
- #### [AKKA](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/index.html)
Akka is a free and open-source toolkit and runtime simplifying the construction of concurrent and distributed applications on the JVM. Akka supports multiple programming models for concurrency, but it emphasizes actor-based concurrency. We have created 4 akka actors, user actor reads data from the dataset and sends it to the supervisor actor which manages several server actors, these server actors are used to simulate chord and finger actors are used to realize the finger table.
- #### [Monte Carlo](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924739/)
Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is used to predict the probability of different outcomes when the intervention of random variables is present. Monte Carlo introduces randomness into our simulation model by randomnly selecting various the operations and values on specifying the total number of operations. Monte Carlo simulation is supported by the integration of the R statistical package in this project.
The simulation is done by generating random requests to the API. In order to introduce randomness, the eval function of the R client is used. 
- #### [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/)
Apache Cassandra is a free and open-source, distributed, wide column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers robust support for clusters spanning multiple datacenters, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients. We have used Cassandra to save the state of server actors, the movie id and movie name has been stored & fetched after the server actor loads the data.
- #### [Akka Cluster Sharding](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/cluster-sharding.html)
Cluster Sharding is an actor deployment model which is useful when it is needed to distribute actors across several nodes in the cluster. Logical identifier of the actors are used to be able to interact with them without being concerned about their physical location in the cluster.

### Coding Structure

- Utility
    - This object file takes a string and number of bits to return hashed value used for generating keys inserted into DHT and for data units.
    - The hashing algorithm used is MD5.
- Data.csv
    - Represents the movie data in id & name format.
- WebService 
    - This is the entry point for our project, this scala file uses Akka-HTTP library for making routes for different options to run the simulations 
    by calling methods for required simulation task.
    - After running this object file you get a link ```http://localhost:8080/``` which will redirect to the webpage with 2 options: 
    
### 1.Chord
- After clicking on chord you will redirected to the webpage with 6 buttons:
    - Add Node : Clicking this button calls method createServerNode() which adds node.
    - Load Data : Clicking this button calls method loadData(id.toInt) which loads the result in the form of string in the server. To load data append ?id=<any integer> to your link.
    - Lookup Data : Clicking this button calls method getData(id.toInt) which is used by the user to look data over a server node using Chord Protocol. To look-up data append ?id=<any integer> to your link.
    - Snapshot : Clicking this button simply returns all the result for the simulation.
    - Remove Node : Clicking this button calls method removeNode() which remove node.
    - Montecarlo : Clicking this button invokes the Rclient object to randomly select the 4 options from above. The 4 options are generated randomly and they are : 1.AddNode, 2.Snapshot, 3.LoadData, 4.LookupData. To use Monte-Carlo append ?number=<any integer> to your link.
        
- ChordActorDriver
    - This object file defines the number of users, servers, ActorSystem, Actors (serverActor, userActor, supervisorActor, fingerActor).
    - It also defines methods used by Webservices and defined in the actor class files to load data, lookup data and display the result.

-  ServerActor
    - This class file represents actor-server which implements chord algorithm and defines messages as follows:
        - case class initializeFirstFingerTable(nodeIndex: Int) : It initializes the first finger table for the first server-node.
        - case class initializeFingerTable(nodeIndex: Int, activeNodes: mutable.TreeSet[Int]) : It initializes the finger table for all the server nodes after the first one.
        - case class updateOthers(activeNodes: mutable.TreeSet[Int]) : It updates all nodes whose finger table should refer to the new node which joins the network.
        - case class updateTable(s: Int, i: Int) : It is invoked by updateOthers which recursively updates finger-table.

## Evaluation of results

After understanding the concepts CAN & the Chord algorithm, we have implemented both the algorithms. The differences between both the algorithms have been highlighted using the below statistics. We have added 8 nodes to each architecture & compared add, remove, load & lookup times for first and the average of other iterations. 


### Differences

![Diff](https://bitbucket.org/cs441-fall2020/group_6/raw/03cf5431d2c9720f7fcb272861c6bd18539aa89b/image/comp.PNG)

- The Chord and CAN are both distributed P2P infrastructures. However, they are different in their architectures. Chord nodes form a ring or circle, and they just keep track of ranges/buckets using Finger Table. Whereas in CAN, a virtual multi-dimensional Cartesian coordinate space is formed and the nodes keep track of their immediate neighbours only. 
- The Chord implementation increases linearly since active nodes times finger table entries determine performance rather than CAN which increases polynomially as Nodes times Neighbours determine performance. 
- Likewise, this is evident by the number of nodes in the architecture. Chord performance remains more or less the same as long as the ring size is the same. But, for CAN the difference is noticeable. As nodes increase, performance suffers.
- Add node for both algorithms shows stark difference, since in Chord we have to update all the finger tables when a new node is added. Whereas in CAN, only the node being split & the corresponding neighbours are updated.
- Load data works differently for both as in Chord, only a particular node is responsible for that key. So, the data has to be loaded to that key only. CAN has a liberty of loading the data anywhere. Thus, it performs better.
- Lookup data is debatable as Chord achieves constant execution times due to limited hops. However, CAN shows inconsistency since routing between 2 nodes only occurs by hoping through neighbours. As we increase the number of nodes, this metric suffers.
- Similar to add, remove node in Chord deals with updating all the nodes's finger tables. Whereas, in CAN only the neighbours are concerned with the deletion.
- Chord's performance shown is slighly  poorer to CAN as per the above diagram but that is down to size of the architecture, the presence of multiple actors & their communication as compared to CAN. However, as the number of nodes will increase, the statistics would turn around due to the growth of their functions.
